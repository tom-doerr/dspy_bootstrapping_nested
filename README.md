# DSPy Bootstrapping Nested Demo
The code in `main.py` demos how you can use compiled DSPy programs to optimize DSPy programs.

## Logprobs
Please note this code is using logprobs to score the output, which is currently only available when using the OpenAI API or using my custom DSPy version that adds support for vLLM logprobs.

## Dataset
The dataset gets generated by the LM in the script itself.
